			<h3>Photoplethysmograph (PPG)</h3>
			<p>At Vellore institute of technolgy (VIT), we had some courses which had project courses. This was one of the project. It has been uploaded as a 
				video in youtube. <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mh0m2fDG9k&t">Click here for video</a> </p>
				The project used LIFA - Labview Interface for Ardunio. The main idea behind the Labview VI was to place a "inti", "analog read", and a "close block" in 
				a  loop (similar to any sensor reading tutorial in youtube, e.g. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWCsaR-oOr8">Arduino meets LabVIEW: Reading Analog Signals of POT in LabVIEW</a>).
				However, a better way to do this will be to use a protocol such as SPI or I2C which will allow time locked data aquisition.
