			<p>Some features of  rpi in which I was interested were Wifi connectivity, and its compatiblity to do i/o operations using MATLAB.Some links are <a href ="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/"> buy</a>,
			<a href = "https://www.mathworks.com/help/supportpkg/raspberrypiio/"> MATLAB-rpi</a>.</p>
			
			<p><b>Update 29th Dec 2020: Wifi connection to rpi</b>
			<ul>
			<li>MATLAB advices to configure rpi settings through command line. I noticed a error "Illegal instruction" while doing that. However,
			doing <code>mypi = raspi(ipaddress,username,password)</code> worked in MATLAB. ipaddress can be found by usig  <code>ifconfig</code> in shell for rpi (via puTTY or related).My ip looks like <code>192.X....</code> </li>
						<li>To enable Serial peripheral interface(SPI) in MATLAB you need to go to the shell again and run <code>sudo raspi-config</code>, 
				go to interfacing options and find SPI, follow the steps. This can be checked in MATLAB <code>mypi.AvailableSPIChannels</code> .</li>
