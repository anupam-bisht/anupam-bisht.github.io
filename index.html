			<p>Hello! My name is Anupam Bisht. I am a PhD student at the University of Calgary, Canada (Jan 2021 - present). My research work deals with building and testing recording and
			stimulating technolgies for the use in freely moving rodent experiments. In the free time, I work on electronics, admire scientists by reading about them,
			,and like to spend time with friends and family, run and bike during summer. Feel free to send me your thoughts/comments/questions at anupam(dot)bisht(at)ucalagary(dot)ca.</p>
