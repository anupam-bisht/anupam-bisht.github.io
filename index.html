			<p>Hello! My name is Anupam Bisht. I am a PhD student at the University of Calgary, Canada. My research work deals with building and testing recording and
			stimulating technolgies for the use in freely moving rodent experiments. In the free time, I work on electronics, admire scientists by reading about them,
			,like to spend time with friends and family, run and bike during summer. Feel free to send me your thoughts/comments/questions at anupam(dot)bisht(at)ucalagary(dot)ca</p>
