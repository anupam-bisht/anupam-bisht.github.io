			<p>I work with electronics/coding/interfacing as part of my research, and also in my free time. This page is aimed to document some of the interesting which 
				I come across or use. The coding part is mostly for interfacing sensors/coding.</a>.</p>

			<h2>PIC Microcontroller</h2>
			
			<p>PIC - Harvard architecture microcontroller, Wikipedia says <i>"generally thought to mean Peripheral Interface Controller, was initially Programmable 
			   Interface Controller, and currently stands for Programmable Intelligent Computer"</i></p>
			
			<h3>Interfacing a Flash Memory</h3>
			<p>Flash memory can be interfaced using SPI protocol. The flash behaves like a slave, while the PIC is a master. 
			The 4 lines required are Serial Input (SI), Serial Output (SO), Clock (SCK) and Chip Select or Slave Select (SS).
			PPS register in the PIC gives the abitlity to configure the pins to the SI, SO, SCK. The SS can be any General Purspose
			input-output pin (GPIO). </p>

			<h2>Raspberry Pi (Rpi)</h2>
			
			<p>Some features of  rpi in which I was interested were Wifi connectivity, and its compatiblity to do i/o operations using MATLAB.Some links are <a href ="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/"> buy</a>,
			<a href = "https://www.mathworks.com/help/supportpkg/raspberrypiio/"> MATLAB-rpi</a>.</p>
			
			<p><b>Update 29th Dec 2020: Wifi connection to rpi</b>
			<ul>
			<li>MATLAB advices to configure rpi settings through command line. I noticed an error "Illegal instruction" while doing that. However,
			doing <code>mypi = raspi(ipaddress,username,password)</code> worked in MATLAB. ipaddress can be found by usig  <code>ifconfig</code> in shell for rpi (via puTTY or related).My ip looks like <code>192.X....</code> </li>
						<li>To enable Serial peripheral interface(SPI) in MATLAB you need to go to the shell again and run <code>sudo raspi-config</code>, 
				go to interfacing options and find SPI, follow the steps. This can be checked in MATLAB <code>mypi.AvailableSPIChannels</code> .</li>
