				<h2>A Student Guide</h2>
				<p>I have received multiple messages through known and unknown contacts over the months with questions about living, studying and 
					managing as a student. In this section, I list some of the things. Feel free to contact me if you need some extra opinions. I will keep addding
					and removing stuff as required. <font color="red"><b> Note: Most information will be based on my experinces in University of Calgary and Calgary city. Also, 
					please take everything here with a pinch of salt. Details will give you an idea, but I have no gaurantee will work or be exact.</b></font> </p>

				 <ul>
					<li>Select a program/department. </li>

					<li>Write a good email. Remind after 1-2 weeks if required.Note: Email should have a clear subject.Including details
					about your interests and why specifically you are interested in the lab will improve the quality of the email.</li>
				 </ul>
			
				<h3>Questions about Immigrations, finance document, etc. </h3>
				Best way is to contact your university. At the university of Calgary there is a service called <a href = "https://www.ucalgary.ca/student-services/iss/immigration">Immigration Services</a>
				offered by the <a href= " https://www.ucalgary.ca/student-services/iss">ISS - International Student Services</a>.

			<h3>Transit in Calgary</h3>
				<ul><li>Transit in Calgary is mainly Busses and the Light Rail Transit - LRT (similar to Metro in India/U-Bahn in Germany).
					The university (rather the government) has made a scheme (simialr to buspass for students), something called
					UPASS, which is a sticker in the ID-Card. It allows you to ride in any of the busses or LRTs. We pay for it
					in the fees.</li> 
					<li>In case you do not have the UPASS you can purchase a ticket from some stores, online,or the LRT station. You can use
						same ticket you get from the LRT in the bus. Check website of the <a href = "https://www.calgarytransit.com/fares-passes/where-buy"> Calgary Transit</a> for
						more upto date information. Typical ticket valid for 90 mins is about $3.5. However, day passes are also available. 
					</li>
					<li>One can also apply for the <a href = "https://www.calgarytransit.com/fares-passes/passes/low-income-monthly-pass">Low income pass</a> , however it needs one to file taxes. The application requires us to prove
					that our income is below a certain limit. One way is through the document which is produced during filing taxes. </li>
					</ul>
